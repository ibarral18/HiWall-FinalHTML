## How to make changes:

If using a Mac:

1. Open Terminal
2. cd into the directory you want the repo to be cloned into
3. run "git clone https://github.com/ibarral18/HiWall-FinalHTML.git"
4. cd into the newly cloned HiWall-FinalHTML folder
5. Edit the code however you want (aka using VSCode, vim, etc.)
6. run "git add ." (run git pull before this maybe)
7. run "git commit -m "insert your message here, ex. I added the chats page"
8. run "git push"
9. Your changes should be reflected in the github repo master now!
10. Make sure to run "git pull" to ensure your branch is up to date with master

## Note: Commit your changes regularly AND before editing each time, run "git pull" to update your local branch with the most recent version of master
